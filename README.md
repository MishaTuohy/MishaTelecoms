# MishaTelecoms | Personal Project
---
## Description
MishaTelecoms is an application that handles/manages [CDR Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record).
The end goal of the app is to have a Web UI where you can log on and manage your CDR Data and the users associated with it.

This application makes use of Domain Driven Design and Microservices Architechture for handling complexity, allowing for changes to be made easily
as the application evoles along with my skills as a programmer.
